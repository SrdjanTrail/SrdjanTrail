<!--
**SrdjanTrail/SrdjanTrail** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the 100DaysOfCode challenge
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Drones, 3D printing, Coding and all the nerd stuff, really.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: srdjan.gudalovic@hotmail.com (Website is in progress and will be done soon!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an INTJ if that means anything to you.
